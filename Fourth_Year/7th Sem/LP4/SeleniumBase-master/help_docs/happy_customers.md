<h3>Case Study: (<i>HubSpot</i>)</h3>

In addition to using SeleniumBase for testing the UI of their content management system, HubSpot used SeleniumBase to automate the migration of website pages from their old CMS to their new one, which saved them over one million USD and a significant amount of time.
