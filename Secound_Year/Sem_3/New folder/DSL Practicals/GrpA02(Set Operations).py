# Group A - 2. In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students
# play badminton and group C students play football. Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
# a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
# b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
# c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
# d) Number of student who play cricket and football but not badminton.
# (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)

# List Of Student as per Games they Play
